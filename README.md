# Jenbot
My personal discord bot which will have many different uses and quirks. 

This bot is not currently hosted, so therefore if you would like to use it in your own servers you would have to set it
up yourself.

## Current Features 
- Retrieving `chess.com` user statistics
- Trivia
- Creating server events
- Using the [ImageSharp](https://sixlabors.com/products/imagesharp/) library to create an "Inspirational Quote"
